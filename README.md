# Tyruswoo Patched AltimitMovement for RPG Maker MZ

Tyruswooâ€™s modification of the open-source pixel movement plugin Altimit Movement!

This modified plugin provides a command to recalculate tile boundaries. This allows Tyruswoo Altimit Movement to be used with Tile Control MZ.

## Usage

Plugin will automatically apply when ON.

## About

- Modified from AltimitMovement Version 0.50 Beta
- Website: https://github.com/AltimitSystems/mv-plugins/tree/master/movement

## Basics of how to use this plugin

This plugin does not require Tile Control to run. The plugin is a modified
version of AltimitMovement, with an added feature of being able to use a
plugin command (or script) to recalculate the map collision mesh. This is
useful if Tile Control changed any tiles from passable to impassible, or
vice versa.

To use this plugin, you can use a plugin command each time you want the
map's collision mesh to be recalculated.

## Plugin Command

| Plugin Command                       | Description                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Recalculate Collision Mesh           | Informs AltimitMovement that it    |
|                                      | needs to recalculates the map's    |
|                                      | collision mesh. Use this script    |
|                                      | after completing any tile changes  |
|                                      | affecting passability, so that the |
|                                      | AltimitMovement plugin recognizes  |
|                                      | the changed tiles.                 |

## Script calls (Advanced)

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
$gameMap.recalculateCollisionMesh(); | This is the script call run by the plugin command "Recalculate Collision Mesh". |
